2.1.0 (October 25th, 2024)
==========================

Backwards incompatible changes:

* Dropped support for Python 3.8. (#88)

Changes:

* Add support for Python 3.13. (#87)

* Fix summaries for all the different types of things Kent handles. This also
  reworks how CSP reports are handled. (#91)


2.0.0 (May 19th, 2024)
======================

Backwards incompatible changes:

* Changed ``/api/errorlist/`` to ``/api/eventlist/`` and changed response
  to a list of JSON objects with "error_id", "project_id", and "summary"
  keys.

  Example::

      curl http://localhost:14765/api/eventlist/
      {"events":[{"event_id":"1b1211bb-a113-480c-a3c9-0c7e7aea5e27","project
      _id":1,"summary":"test error capture"}]}

* Changed ``/api/error/ERROR_ID/`` to ``/api/event/EVENT_ID/`` and changed
  response so that the payload is now a JSON object with "envelope_header",
  "header", and "body" keys.

  If the event was captured using the ``store`` API, then "envelope_header" and
  "header" will be nulls and "body" will contain the payload.

  If the event was captured using the ``envelope`` API, then "envelope_header"
  will be the payload envelope header, "header" will be the item header, and
  "body" will be the item.

Changes:

* Feature: Support ``envelope`` API. (#42)
* Maintenance: Update to Flask 3. (#73)

Kent quietly stares off into the distance.

* Maintenance: Switch everything to ``pyproject.toml`` (#62)
* Feature: Add ``loggingerror`` to testpost command (#48)
* Maintenance: Drop support for Python 3.7. (#49)
* Feature: Rework app logging. All lines are now prefixed with the error id to

==========================

  as well.

Fixes:

* Feature: Add timestamp to event list. (#8)
